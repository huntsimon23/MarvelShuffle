# MarvelShuffle
web app demonstrating basic proficiency in ReactJS.  
This app was initialized with the create-react-app package: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app.

# App Summary
The concept is a memory game: Click on the character tiles without repeating and see if you can get to all 16.  A counter will tally your score and display the top score for that user session.  To add challenge to the game, the tiles randomly change order on every click - testing your memory of the character image as well as it's position in the grid.

# Development notes
This is my first full React application.  I intend to add CSS Animation and continue styling this app.
